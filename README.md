# Data-Preparation-And-Analysis

1. This small project gathers data fetched by an Open-API provided by RapidAPI.
2. The dataset consists of Food Calorie Data Search. I chose to gather data specific to Fruits from all Food Categories.
3. Then I performed pre-processing of data and prepared an analysis using different visualizations indicating which fruits provide what vital elements to our body.
